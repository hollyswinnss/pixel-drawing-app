# Pixel Drawing Application â€“ Final Project

## Overview
This project is a fully featured pixel drawing application built using **p5.js**.  
It began as a simple template and has been extended with numerous advanced features,  
making it both a creative tool and a demonstration of modular programming, object orientation,  
and user-focused design.

## Features

- **Undo & Redo System**  
  Allows users to revert or repeat their drawing actions. Built with a history stack  
  to track changes across tools.

- **Export with Confetti Animation**  
  Users can export their artwork as an image. A confetti animation is triggered on save  
  for playful feedback.

- **Theme Selector**  
  Multiple themes available (pink, blue, green, dark, and light). Colour contrast has been  
  adjusted for accessibility.

## Technical Implementation
- Modular structure: each tool is coded in its own file (e.g., `pixelBrushTool.js`, `zoomTools.js`).
- Object-oriented approach: constructors and methods define tool behaviour.
- Use of arrays and stacks for undo/redo, as well as nested conditionals and loops  
  for advanced drawing logic.
- Accessibility improvements through theme design and interface responsiveness.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.  
3. Ensure the `p5.js` and `p5.dom.js` libraries are loaded from the `/lib` folder.  

---

## Usage
1. Select a tool from the toolbox.  
2. Draw directly on the canvas.  
3. Use undo/redo to manage mistakes.  
4. Export your artwork when complete (celebrate with confetti ðŸŽ‰).  
5. Switch between themes and zoom levels to personalise your workflow.
